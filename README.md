# Assignment 5.1 â€“ Multi-Agent RAG Research Assistant

## Introduction

In this project, we developed an intelligent, multi-agent research assistant that integrates structured, unstructured, and real-time data sources to deliver comprehensive financial insights about NVIDIA. This assistant uses LangGraph to orchestrate three specialized agents:

- **Snowflake Agent** â€“ handles structured financial valuation data  
- **RAG Agent** â€“ processes quarterly reports using Pinecone  
- **Web Search Agent** â€“ pulls live market updates using APIs

The frontend is built with Streamlit, and the backend uses FastAPI. Both are containerized with Docker and deployed to the cloud.

## Technologies Used

- **Orchestration:** LangGraph  
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone  
- **Structured DB:** Snowflake  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** FastAPI  
- **Deployment:** Docker + Render / Railway  
- **Web Search APIs:** Tavily / SerpAPI

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a system that can intelligently combine historical financial data, structured company metrics, and the latest market trends. By leveraging LangGraphâ€™s agent orchestration, the assistant enables seamless collaboration between the Snowflake, RAG, and Web agents. The result is an integrated platform for answering research questions with real-time insights, document-based context, and structured financial data.

##  Proof of Concept

The system is broken down into three core components:

### ðŸ”¹ RAG Agent (Unstructured Data)
- NVIDIA quarterly reports are stored in S3
- Parsed and chunked into Pinecone with Year/Quarter metadata
- Enables semantic and filtered retrieval

### ðŸ”¹ Snowflake Agent (Structured Data)
- Financial metrics from Yahoo Finance are loaded into Snowflake
- Enables SQL querying and returns formatted text summaries and charts

### ðŸ”¹ Web Search Agent (Real-time Insights)
- Uses Tavily / SerpAPI to fetch current news related to NVIDIA
- Provides market sentiment and news context

LangGraph orchestrates the agent flow, FastAPI connects frontend to backend, and the whole project runs via Docker containers.

##  Walkthrough of the Application
- Enter a research query and filter by **Year** and **Quarter**
- Choose agents to trigger:
  -  Snowflake Agent  
  -  RAG Agent  
  -  Web Search Agent
- View the structured research report:
  - Summaries  
  - Financial visualizations  
  - Web insights
